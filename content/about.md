### Hi there, I'm Karan Yadav
Thank you for visiting my site. I am a hobbyist programmer from Ghaziabad, India. I like to learn all things related to tech. Currently, I work as a Ruby on Rails Software Engineer and learn about web servers and backend web frameworks in my free time.

On this site I write about the things I find interesting or the things I am currently exploring.
